This project evaluates six approaches to constructing SRI portfolios in the South African 
market, using traditional (mean-variance, na√Øve and risk parity) and AI methods (particle swarm 
optimisation, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm). Portfolios are constructed using inputs 
from estimation windows and compared in terms of risk-adjusted returns, diversification and 
stability based on out-of-sample investment windows. 
Using python to develop both traditional and the AI models.
