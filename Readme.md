This project evaluates six approaches to constructing socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolios in the South African 
market, using traditional (mean-variance, na√Øve/equally weighting and risk parity) and AI methods (particle swarm 
optimisation, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm). Portfolios are constructed using inputs 
from estimation windows and compared in terms of risk-adjusted returns, diversification and 
stability based on out-of-sample investment windows. 
For the purposes of this study, 40 constituents of the J113 FTSE/JSE Responsible Index 
as at January 2024 are utilised as the assets for the construction of the SRI portfolio as 
these have already been screened based on their ESG scores, and for the non-SRI portfolios the JSE top 40 assets were used.
Using python to develop both traditional and the AI models.
AI algorithms produced optimal SRI portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns on average. In a 
period of positive market returns, the genetic algorithm performed best, followed by simulated 
annealing and particle swarm optimisation. 
During the period of negative market returns, the 
mean-variance approach dominated, followed by simulated annealing and particle swarm 
optimisation. Over the entire period, the genetic algorithm performed best for the SRI portfolios 
followed by the simulated annealing and the mean-variance approaches.
Largely, the results point to meta-heuristic approaches 
yielding superior for both constrained (SRI) and non-constrained (non-SRI) portfolios although 
these portfolios do exhibit higher concentration and less stable weights. When comparing SRI to 
non-SRI portfolios using the Sharpe ratio, SRI portfolios outperformed in the first period but 
lagged in the second period. Overall, non-SRI portfolios outperformed SRI portfolios, regardless 
of the portfolio construction method. These findings suggest that while AI approaches offer 
advantages in portfolio construction, investors should recognise that SRI strategies do not always 
outperform conventional investments.
